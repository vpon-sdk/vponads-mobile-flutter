Case Background - Traffic Behavior Changes with the Pandemic
The global automotive industry experienced a significant downtrend last year, but Taiwan’s automotive market recorded the highest growth rate within the past five years. The pandemic situation and government subsidies are the primary reasons that Taiwan can grow against the tide. Meanwhile, the public was also concerned about using mass transportation system, which gave rise to a new demand for automobiles and drove new car sales during COVID.

In response to the situation, Vpon aims to bring value to the industry by leveraging advanced data tech and solutions to cope with pandemic change, helping our client develop a corresponding marketing plan to uncover more potential customers and create business opportunities.
